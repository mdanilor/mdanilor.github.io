      <title>[Cracking Windows Kernel with HEVD] Chapter 4: How do we write a shellcode to elevate privileges and gracefully return to userland?</title>

      <description>The end is near Throughout the previous four chapters, everything we have been doing was basically exploiting a stack-based buffer overflow and bypassing a few kernel mitigations. Apart from the kernel-specific memory mitigations, until this point the exploitation has been as vanilla as it gets: a stack overflow with no canary.
In this final post, we will dive into Windows privilege mechanism and use it to elevate our privileges. Then, we must return to userland.</description>

      <description>Cracking HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver: Can we rop our way into triggering our shellcode? When are we building the payload here? Patience! Thus far we have seen the basics to correctly assemble a usable payload. Now that we have all the tools necessary, let&amp;rsquo;s finally create our payload. May the force be with us. If you missed the previous posts, make sure to check them out.
Our ROP chain should look something like this:</description>

      <description>Cracking HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver: Is there a way to bypass kASLR, SMEP and KVA Shadow? Where to redirect the execution flow? On the previous post, we wrote a program that would crash our driver and leave us with a BSOD. We managed to discover the return address offset and redirect the program flow to an arbitrary address. But we were left with a question: what now? Where to redirect the execution flow?</description>

      <description>Cracking HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver: will this driver ever crash? Writing a BSOD crash Last time we focused on setting up the environment. This time we will try to understand the vulnerability and make our system crash! Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in!
The vulnerable code (...) ULONG KernelBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = { 0 }; (...) // Verify if the buffer resides in user mode ProbeForRead(UserBuffer, sizeof(KernelBuffer), (ULONG)__alignof(UCHAR)); DbgPrint(&amp;quot;[+] UserBuffer: 0x%p\n&amp;quot;, UserBuffer); DbgPrint(&amp;quot;[+] UserBuffer Size: 0x%zX\n&amp;quot;, Size); DbgPrint(&amp;quot;[+] KernelBuffer: 0x%p\n&amp;quot;, &amp;amp;KernelBuffer); DbgPrint(&amp;quot;[+] KernelBuffer Size: 0x%zX\n&amp;quot;, sizeof(KernelBuffer)); (.</description>

      <description>Cracking HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver: where do I start? What is this? Hello! Previously we exploited vulnerable linux driver by invictus-0x90. If you missed, not to worry: this series is totally unrelated, since we&amp;rsquo;ll be exploiting the vulnerable Windows driver HEVD. However, if you are a curious one, make sure to check the other post!
Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be attacking HEVD: HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver. This Windows driver is intentionally vulnerable to many memory corruption vulnerabilities (stack overflow, int overflow, use after free, type confusion, to name a few).</description>

      <description>Hi! Long time no see, huh? I must apologize for my lousy post schedule. In spite of covid-19 outbreak forcing us to stay home, it appears that I&amp;rsquo;ve never had less time to spare in my life. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.
Memory corruption issues often lead to pretty serious vulnerabilities. It is not uncommon for a stack or heap overflow, use-after-free, double free and others to lead to code execution.</description>

      <description>So my OSCP PWK lab starts next saturday. Throughout the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly preparing myself to start the lab. Solved dozens of CTF VMs on vulnhub and tryhackme. One VM that particularly caught my attention is hosted on TryHackMe, a brilliant platform for security enthusiasts and professionals to practice their skills. This VM is Buffer Overflow Prep, which, according to friends who have taken the exam, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to the OSCP exam BoF machine.</description>

      <description>Hello, kernel: Exploiting an intentionally vulnerable Linux driver Intro and setup About a month ago I started doing some research during both my freetime and work hours (shout out to SiDi for allowing me the time!!!) on Kernel Linux exploitation. I find this to be not only a fascinating topic, but a very useful one too, since one of my primary functions at work is to assess the Android system.</description>
