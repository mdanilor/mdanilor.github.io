      <description>About the challenge d3ctf was a Chinese CTF which occurred a few months ago. I did not participate, but I was looking for CTFs on UEFI firmware exploitation and I found d3guard: a challenge from this CTF which was exactly what I was looking for.
I would like to start stating that I found this challenge to be extremely difficult. In fact, it was one of the hardest I have done so far.</description>
