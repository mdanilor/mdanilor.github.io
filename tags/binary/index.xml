      <description>About the challenge d3ctf was a Chinese CTF which occurred a few months ago. I did not participate, but I was looking for CTFs on UEFI firmware exploitation and I found d3guard: a challenge from this CTF which was exactly what I was looking for.
I would like to start stating that I found this challenge to be extremely difficult. In fact, it was one of the hardest I have done so far.</description>

      <description>So my OSCP PWK lab starts next saturday. Throughout the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly preparing myself to start the lab. Solved dozens of CTF VMs on vulnhub and tryhackme. One VM that particularly caught my attention is hosted on TryHackMe, a brilliant platform for security enthusiasts and professionals to practice their skills. This VM is Buffer Overflow Prep, which, according to friends who have taken the exam, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to the OSCP exam BoF machine.</description>
