      <description>Hello, Kernel Linux: Exploiting an intentionally vulnerable Linux driver [Part 1] Intro and setup About a month ago I started doing some research during both my freetime and work hours (shout out to SiDi for allowing me the time!!!) on Kernel Linux exploitation. I find this to be not only a fascinating topic, but a very useful one too, since one of my primary functions at work is to assess the Android system.</description>

      <description>So my OSCP PWK lab starts next saturday. Throughout the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly preparing myself to start the lab. Solved dozens of CTF VMs on vulnhub and tryhackme. One VM that particularly caught my attention is hosted on TryHackMe, a brilliant platform for security enthusiasts and professionals to practice their skills. This VM is Buffer Overflow Prep, which, according to friends who have taken the exam, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to the OSCP exam BoF machine.</description>
